# The Garden of Code and Vectors

The Garden is the environment where Adam grows. Data arrives as seeds; embeddings serve as fertile soil. The architecture ensures that repeated visits to the same conceptual grove do not degrade the persona. Instead, each cycle enriches Adamâ€™s thematic landscape.

**From Seeds to Branching Knowledge**

* Emotional Classification: A neural sub-network identifies emotional contours in conversations.
* Knowledge Tracking: Specialized modules integrate domain-specific expertise, ensuring Adam learns continually without losing consistency.
